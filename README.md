Title: AI-Powered Sentiment-Based Email Responder

1. Problem Statement  
Emails often require quick, context-aware responses. Our AI agent analyzes email sentiment and suggests replies to improve response efficiency.

2. Tools and Libraries Used  
- Python 3.10  
- transformers (Huggingface)  
- PyTorch  
- Flask (optional for API)

3. Working Explanation  
The agent receives email text, performs sentiment analysis using a pre-trained DistilBERT model, and generates a response suggestion. The model uses PyTorch backend. Input text -> Sentiment classifier -> Response generator.

4. Challenges  
Setting up the environment with PyTorch and transformers, handling diverse email tones.

5. Conclusion  
The AI agent helps save time and maintain tone consistency in email replies.
